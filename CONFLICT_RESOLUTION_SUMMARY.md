# PR #44 Merge Conflict Resolution Summary

## Problem
Pull Request #44 (`codex/fix-yaml-indentation-in-.yarnrc.yml`) had merge conflicts preventing it from being merged into `main`.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Conflicts Identified
1. **package.json**: Different ordering of entries in the `resolutions` object
   - PR branch: `"@netlify/edge-functions"` first, then `"esbuild"`
   - Main branch: `"esbuild"` first, then `"@netlify/edge-functions"`

2. **yarn.lock**: Critical corruption issue
   - Main branch had a severely truncated yarn.lock (only 42 lines)
   - This truncation occurred in commit `af8f054` which removed 31,468 lines
   - The truncated file was malformed with incorrect YAML indentation
   - Original PR branch also had corrupted lockfile (40 lines)

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Merged Main into PR Branch
```bash
git fetch origin codex/fix-yaml-indentation-in-.yarnrc.yml:codex/fix-yaml-indentation-in-.yarnrc.yml
git fetch origin main:main
git checkout codex/fix-yaml-indentation-in-.yarnrc.yml
git merge main
```

### 2. Resolved package.json Conflict
- Chose alphabetical ordering for maintainability
- Final resolutions:
```json
"resolutions": {
  "@netlify/edge-functions": "npm:2.18.2",
  "esbuild": "0.25.5"
}
```

### 3. Fixed yarn.lock Corruption
- Identified that both branches had corrupted lockfiles
- Restored yarn.lock from commit `24c1355` (last known good state with 31,474 lines)
- Ran `yarn install --mode=update-lockfile` to update dependencies
- Result: Valid yarn.lock with 31,509 lines

### 4. Verified Resolution
```bash
yarn install --mode=update-lockfile
# Successfully updated lockfile
# Added: @netlify/dev-utils@4.2.0, @netlify/edge-functions@2.18.2, @netlify/types@2.0.3
# Removed: @netlify/edge-functions@3.0.1
```

## Files Modified

### .yarnrc.yml
- Auto-merged successfully
- Retained main branch's improvements (comment about resolutions, packageExtensions for @netlify/edge-functions-dev)

### package.json  
- Resolved resolutions ordering conflict
- No functional changes, just ordering

### yarn.lock
- Completely regenerated from valid state
- Now contains all project dependencies correctly
- File size: 31,509 lines (vs 42 in main, 40 in PR branch)

## Merge Commit
- SHA: `c086df4`
- Branch: `codex/fix-yaml-indentation-in-.yarnrc.yml` (local)
- Message: "Merge main into codex/fix-yaml-indentation-in-.yarnrc.yml to resolve conflicts"

## Current Status
✅ All merge conflicts resolved
✅ Lockfile restored and validated
✅ Code is ready for merging
✅ No functional changes to application code

## Next Steps
The resolved state is available on the `copilot/resolve-merge-conflicts` branch in this repository. To complete the resolution of PR #44, these changes need to be applied to the `codex/fix-yaml-indentation-in-.yarnrc.yml` branch on the remote repository.

### Option 1: Cherry-pick the merge commit
```bash
git checkout codex/fix-yaml-indentation-in-.yarnrc.yml
git pull
git merge main
# Resolve using the files from copilot/resolve-merge-conflicts branch
git push
```

### Option 2: Replace files directly
```bash
git checkout codex/fix-yaml-indentation-in-.yarnrc.yml  
git checkout copilot/resolve-merge-conflicts -- .yarnrc.yml package.json yarn.lock
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts with main"
git push
```

## Important Note
The yarn.lock corruption in the main branch (commit `af8f054`) should be investigated. A 31,000+ line lockfile being truncated to 42 lines suggests an error during commit creation or force-push.
