## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text

├── src/
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/

```

To learn more about the folder structure of an Astro project, refer to [our guide on project structure](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/project-structure/).

## Google Merchant Center Feed

This project now includes a helper script that exports current products from Sanity, writes a tab-separated file, and (optionally) uploads it to Google Merchant Center via SFTP.

1. Add the following environment variables (see `.env.example` for placeholders): `GMC_SFTP_HOST`, `GMC_SFTP_PORT`, `GMC_SFTP_USERNAME`, `GMC_SFTP_PASSWORD`, `GMC_SFTP_FEED_FILENAME`, `GMC_FEED_BASE_URL`, and `GMC_FEED_CURRENCY`.
2. Install new dependencies if you haven’t already: `yarn install`.
3. (Optional) Set defaults such as `GMC_FEED_DEFAULT_WEIGHT_LB` (fallback when a product lacks a shipping weight) and `GMC_FEED_DEFAULT_QUANTITY`.
4. Generate and upload the feed: `yarn merchant:upload`.

The feed file is written to `tmp/<filename>` locally before being pushed to Google. If SFTP credentials are missing, the script still writes the local file so you can inspect or upload it manually.
