# Checkout Shipping Audit

## Inventory (relevant files)
- `src/pages/api/checkout.ts` (fas-cms-fresh): builds line items, loads `shippingConfig` from Sanity, runs `estimateShippingForCart`/`buildShippingQuote` (lines 224‑440) and writes `shipping_options` + metadata that Stripe collects on redirect (lines 820‑940).
- `src/pages/api/webhooks.ts` (fas-cms-fresh): listens for Stripe `checkout.session.completed`, assembles product shipping snapshots, reads `session.metadata.shipping_*`, and writes the Sanity `order` document with `weight`, `dimensions`, `carrier`, `service`, `shippoRateId`, and `shippingAddress` (lines 460‑640).
- `netlify/functions/getShippingQuoteBySkus.ts` (fas-sanity): queries the same Sanity catalog, enforces freight/install rules, creates an Shippo shipment, fetches `shipment.rates` + SmartRates, and returns live `rates`, `bestRate`, and `packages` to the caller (lines 200-520).
- An `_type == "shippingQuote"` cache document now stores `quoteKey`, `quoteRequestId`, `shippoShipmentId`, `source`, `rateCount`, `cartSummary`, `createdAt`, and `expiresAt` so repeated cart/address combos reuse the same Shippo shipment until the TTL expires.
- `netlify/functions/createCheckoutSession.ts` (fas-sanity): accepts `cart` + user-selected shipping rate, enriches Stripe line items with product weight/dimensions metadata, builds `shipping_options` from the Shippo rate, and persists a `checkoutSession` document (lines 150‑420).
- `src/pages/api/create-shipping-label.ts` (fas-sanity): purchases a label via Shippo using saved order data, marks `labelPurchased`, stores tracking info, and links the Shippo shipment ID into the Sanity `order` doc.
- `netlify/functions/shippoWebhook.ts` + `stripe-shipping-webhook.ts` (fas-sanity): receive Shippo/Stripe events and update `order.shippingStatus`, `shippingLog`, `trackingNumber`, `shippingLabelUrl`, etc., including `linkShipmentToOrder` (shippo webhook lines 1‑260 & 714) and idempotent logging of webhook events (stripe shipping webhook lines 1‑210).
- `packages/sanity-config/src/schemaTypes/documents/order.tsx` (shared package): defines `order.weight`, `order.dimensions`, `order.shippingAddress`, `order.carrier/service/trackingNumber`, and the shipping log/status fields that downstream automation relies on (lines 500‑720).

## Current flow (cart → checkout → Stripe → order → shipping)
1. **fas-cms cart → checkout (Stripe)**: the storefront collects cart items (no shipping address yet), POSTs to `/api/checkout`, builds Stripe line items + shipping quote via `estimateShippingForCart` (no carrier call), and calls `stripe.checkout.sessions.create` with a single `shipping_option` based on that quote (lines 224‑940 of `src/pages/api/checkout.ts`). The newly-created session returns a `url` to redirect the customer into Stripe Checkout, which then asks for shipping/billing info.
2. **Stripe completes payment**: Stripe triggers `/api/webhooks.ts`, which reads the session, extracts shipping metadata (e.g., `shipping_rate_label`, `shipping_rate_amount`, `shipping_delivery_days`), and uses persisted product shipping weights/dims to populate `order.weight`, `order.dimensions`, and `order.shippingAddress`. It writes carrier/service/`shippoRateId` from the metadata into the Sanity `order` (lines 509‑640).
3. **Shipping fulfillment**: Currently the order doc contains only the calculated quote, and the shipping status is managed via Sanity (shared schema) plus Shippo/Stripe webhooks (`netlify/functions/shippoWebhook.ts`, `stripe-shipping-webhook.ts`). There is no upstream `fas-cms` call to a carrier; the fulfillment subsystem has historically relied on Sanity/`fas-sanity` tooling that assumes Shippo label purchases happen through the backend tools (`create-shipping-label.ts` and manual workflows).
4. **fas-sanity shipping tooling (parallel path)**: Separately, the Sanity site already exposes a shipping component (`src/components/CheckoutShipping.tsx`) that collects shipping address, calls `/.netlify/functions/getShippingQuoteBySkus`, and passes the chosen Shippo rate into `/.netlify/functions/createCheckoutSession.ts`, which creates a Stripe Checkout session with explicit shipping metadata and caches a checkout snapshot. This tooling already charges live carrier rates and writes to the same Sanity dataset, but it is not wired into the main `fas-cms` storefront today.

## Where shipping is computed now
- `estimateShippingForCart`/`buildShippingQuote` in `src/pages/api/checkout.ts` (lines 224‑440) perform the only shipping math that runs before Stripe checkout on `fasmotorsports.com`. It reads `product.shippingConfig` or falls back to defaults, totals `chargeableWeight`, and applies flat `GROUND_*` or `FREIGHT_*` environment-configured constants to produce `ShippingQuoteResult`. It never calls Shippo, Parcelcraft, or another carrier API.
- The resulting `ShippingQuoteResult` is forced into Stripe via `shipping_options` (lines 820‑923) and is the only shipping amount that Stripe is ever told about from the storefront side.

## Live rate calls today
- **fas-cms-fresh**: **No live carrier call exists.** `checkout.ts` never reaches out to Shippo or any shipping provider; shipping amounts are derived from local weight/dimension heuristics and default environment constants, so Stripe sees a fixed rate (`shipping_rate_data.fixed_amount`).
- **fas-sanity**: `netlify/functions/getShippingQuoteBySkus.ts:200‑520` uses the same Sanity catalog to identify weights/dimensions, then calls `Shippo.Shipment.create` plus `smartrate` to fetch carrier rates (UPS/USPS/FedEx). That function returns the `rates` array plus `bestRate` to the caller, making true live carrier costs available for Stripe and UI components.

## Duplication & risk areas
- Two separate shipping quote implementations share overlapping data (Sanity `product.shippingConfig`, order fields), but only one speaks to carriers. `fas-cms` keeps a local estimator (`estimateShippingForCart`) while `fas-sanity` already wraps Shippo (`getShippingQuoteBySkus`). Maintaining both means: stale logic drift (env constants vs. carrier data), parallel requirements for metadata (`shipping_rate_label` vs. Shippo's `carrier/service/rateId`), and duplicated maintenance.
- Stripe metadata is currently populated differently depending on the flow. The Sanity checkout session (via `createCheckoutSession.ts`) pushes Shippo metadata (`shipping_rate_id`, `carrier`, `service`, `shipping_amount`), while `fas-cms` only pushes the quote label/amount/delivery days. This inconsistency makes downstream automation (webhooks, label purchases) brittle.
- The `getShippingQuoteBySkus` function creates an Shippo shipment for every quote. If `fas-cms` were to call it repeatedly for the same cart/address (e.g., due to retries), multiple unused shipments would accumulate unless we introduce request deduplication or reuse logic.

## Stripe Checkout live-rate statement
**Stripe Checkout currently does _not_ display live carrier rates for the main storefront.** The only shipping rate sent in `src/pages/api/checkout.ts` is the result of the local `buildShippingQuote` heuristic (lines 296‑430) and is wrapped as a single `shipping_options` entry with `shipping_rate_data.fixed_amount` (lines 864‑924). No Shippo/Shippo-backed Netlify function is invoked before the session is created, so Stripe never receives a carrier-derived rate and cannot show live choices to the buyer.

## Cross-repo interaction map
| Caller | Callee / Authority | Payload highlights | Side effects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fas-cms-fresh` `/api/checkout` | Stripe Checkout | Cart line items, `shipping_options` built from `buildShippingQuote`, `cart_id`, deterministic metadata | Creates Stripe session; Stripe later triggers `/api/webhooks.ts` |
| `fas-cms-fresh` `/api/webhooks.ts` | Sanity order doc | Stripe session details, shipping metadata (`shipping_rate_label`, `shipping_rate_amount`, `shipping_delivery_days`) | Persists `order` with `weight`, `dimensions`, `carrier`, `service`, `shippoRateId`, `shippingAddress` |
| `fas-sanity` `getShippingQuoteBySkus` | Sanity catalog + Shippo | `{cart, destination}` → Shippo `Shipment.create`; returns live `rates`, `bestRate`, `shipment.id` | Creates Shippo shipment/smart rates (currently per call) |
| `fas-sanity` `createCheckoutSession` | Stripe Checkout | Same cart + selected Shippo rate (`rateId`, `carrier`, `service`, `deliveryDays`) | Creates Stripe session (used by Sanity storefront) and saves `checkoutSession` document |
| `fas-sanity` `create-shipping-label` / Shippo webhooks | Sanity order shippers | Shippo label purchase, tracking updates | Marks `labelPurchased`, stores `trackingNumber`, updates `shippingStatus` via `shippoWebhook.ts` and `stripe-shipping-webhook.ts` |
