TASK: Audit why checkout on facemotorsports.com does not allow entering or applying
discounts / coupon codes, and identify all missing or incomplete discount-related
features in the checkout flow.

THIS IS A READ-ONLY AUDIT.
DO NOT propose code changes yet.

--------------------------------------------------
SCOPE (fas-cms-fresh)
--------------------------------------------------

Frontend:
- Cart UI (cart drawer / cart page)
- Checkout entry point
- Any coupon / promo UI (or lack thereof)

Backend:
- Stripe Checkout session creation
- Metadata passed to Stripe
- Promotion / coupon validation logic
- Sanity promotion / discount data usage (if any)

Integrations:
- Stripe Coupons
- Stripe Promotion Codes
- Sanity promotion documents
- Customer-level discounts (if applicable)

--------------------------------------------------
FILES TO INSPECT
--------------------------------------------------

Search broadly for:
- checkout
- cart
- discount
- coupon
- promotion
- promo
- stripe.checkout.sessions.create

Likely locations include (but are not limited to):
- src/pages/api/checkout.ts
- src/pages/api/cart/*
- src/components/cart/*
- src/components/checkout/*
- src/lib/stripe*
- src/lib/cart*
- src/lib/promotions*
- src/lib/discount*

--------------------------------------------------
QUESTIONS TO ANSWER (REQUIRED)
--------------------------------------------------

1. Is there any UI for entering a coupon or promo code?
   - If not, where should it logically exist?

2. Does the Stripe Checkout session support:
   - discounts[]
   - promotion_code
   - allow_promotion_codes

3. Are Stripe coupons or promotion codes:
   - fetched?
   - validated?
   - passed to Stripe?

4. Is there any existing Sanity promotion / discount model that is:
   - unused?
   - partially implemented?
   - mismatched with checkout expectations?

5. Are customer-level discounts (military, wholesale, etc.)
   intended but not surfaced at checkout?

6. Are discounts applied:
   - before checkout?
   - during checkout?
   - after checkout only?

7. What is missing vs what is intentionally out of scope?

--------------------------------------------------
DELIVERABLE
--------------------------------------------------

Write a report to:

docs/reports/checkout-discounts-audit.md

The report MUST include:

- A clear explanation of why coupons cannot be entered today
- A list of missing features (UI + backend)
- Any dead or partial discount code paths
- A recommended FIX SEQUENCE (NOT implementation)
  ordered by dependency:
    UI → API → Stripe → Sanity

DO NOT WRITE CODE.
DO NOT SUGGEST PATCHES.
DO NOT ASSUME BUSINESS RULES.
