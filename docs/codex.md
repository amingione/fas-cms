# FAS Codex (Reference Only)

⚠️ This repository does NOT own the Codex.

The authoritative Codex lives here:
fas-sanity/docs/codex.md

All rules, constraints, and execution requirements are defined there.
This file exists only so Codex can discover the rules when operating
from the fas-cms-fresh workspace.

DO NOT modify or duplicate rules here.
