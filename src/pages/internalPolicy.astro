        time-sensitive, business-critical alerts that support internal workflows.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-cyber text-white mt-10 mb-2">1. Scope</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        This policy applies to employees and authorized internal users who have explicitly opted in
        to receive SMS notifications. SMS communications are intended for internal use only and are
        not customer-facing.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-cyber text-white mt-10 mb-2">2. Authorized Message Types</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        SMS messages sent under this policy are transactional and operational in nature and may
        include notifications related to new website orders, vendor or customer messages,
        appointment or service requests, quote submissions, and internal system alerts.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Marketing, promotional, or advertising messages are strictly prohibited from being sent via
        SMS under this policy.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-cyber text-white mt-10 mb-2">3. Opt-In Requirement</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        SMS notifications are sent only to users who have explicitly provided consent through the
        designated employee SMS consent form. Participation is voluntary and is not a condition of
        employment.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-cyber text-white mt-10 mb-2">4. Message Frequency</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Message frequency varies based on operational activity. Messages are event-triggered and
        sent only when awareness or action is required.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-cyber text-white mt-10 mb-2">5. Opt-Out and Help</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Users may opt out of receiving SMS communications at any time by replying STOP to any
        message. For assistance, users may reply HELP or contact support@fasmotorsports.com.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-cyber text-white mt-10 mb-2">6. Data Handling & Privacy</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Phone numbers used for SMS notifications are used exclusively for internal operational
        communications. Mobile information is not sold, shared, or used for marketing or promotional
        purposes and is handled in accordance with applicable privacy requirements.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-cyber text-white mt-10 mb-2">7. Compliance</h2>
